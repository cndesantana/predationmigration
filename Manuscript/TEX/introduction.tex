\section{Introduction}

Understanding the structure and dynamics of ecological networks has become critical for understanding the persistence and stability of ecosystems \cite{dunne2005modeling}. Robustness studies based on the simulation of sequential extinction of species have revealled aspects about the response of ecosystems to ecological disturbances at species level \cite{desantana2013topological}. Such structural analyses are relatively fast and easy but their utility in capturing important information about functions and processes is often questioned \cite{jordan2012simulating}, especially when considered the variability of the effects of ecological disturbances among individuals of the same species. Dynamical models in contrast provide essential information especially if one needs to understand changes in abundances, with the structure of the food web being almost constant \cite{jordan2012simulating}.
